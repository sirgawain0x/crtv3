## Files Unstaged/Not Committed

The following subtitle-related files were unstaged and will remain as untracked files:
- `SUBTITLE_PROCESSING_ERROR_FIX.md`
- `SUBTITLE_PROCESSING_FIX.md`
- `SUBTITLE_PROCESSING_FIX_FINAL.md`
- `SUBTITLE_STORAGE_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
- `supabase/migrations/20250110_add_subtitles_to_video_assets.sql`

## Database Schema

**Note**: The database columns `subtitles` and `subtitles_uri` in the `video_assets` table are being kept for backward compatibility with any existing videos that may have subtitles already stored. However, no new videos will have subtitles generated or stored.

## What's Removed

1. **Audio-to-text processing** - Livepeer's audio-to-text API integration
2. **Subtitle translation** - Google Translate integration for multiple languages (English, Spanish, German, Chinese)
3. **IPFS subtitle storage** - Upload of subtitle JSON files to IPFS
4. **Database subtitle caching** - Storage of subtitles in Supabase for fast access
5. **UI components** - All "Process Subtitles" buttons and status indicators
6. **State management** - All subtitle-related state in upload flow components

## Benefits

✅ **Simplified upload flow** - Fewer steps and less cognitive load for users
✅ **Faster uploads** - No waiting for subtitle processing (30-60 seconds saved per video)
✅ **Reduced complexity** - Less code to maintain and debug
✅ **Fewer error points** - Eliminated multiple potential failure points (download, transcription, translation, IPFS upload, DB save)
✅ **Better UX** - No more confusing "Process Subtitles" vs "Skip" decisions

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test complete video upload flow from start to finish
2. Verify thumbnail generation still works correctly
3. Confirm video publishing completes successfully
4. Check that no subtitle-related errors appear in console
5. Verify MeToken configuration still works in the upload flow

## Future Considerations

If subtitle generation is needed in the future, consider:
- Making it a separate, optional post-publishing feature
- Using a more reliable service than Livepeer's audio-to-text
- Implementing better error handling and retry logic
- Allowing users to upload their own subtitle files instead
