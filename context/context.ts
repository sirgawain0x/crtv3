/**
 * Creative TV - Application Constants
 * ==================================
 *
 * This file contains centralized configuration constants used throughout the Creative TV application.
 * Constants are organized by feature area for improved maintainability and documentation.
 *
 * USAGE GUIDELINES:
 * - Import specific constants where needed rather than importing the entire file
 * - Keep related constants grouped together with clear comments
 * - Add JSDoc comments for non-obvious values or those requiring context
 * - When adding new constants, follow the established pattern and document their purpose
 *
 * IMPORTANT: This file should only contain configuration values, not application state.
 * For stateful contexts, see VideoContext.tsx and OrbisContext.tsx
