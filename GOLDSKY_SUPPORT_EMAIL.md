Hello Goldsky Support Team,

I'm experiencing an issue with my subgraph deployment and would appreciate your assistance.

## Issue Description

My subgraph is showing the error **"Failed to transact block operations"** in the Goldsky dashboard. The subgraph appears to be stuck and unable to process new blocks.

## Subgraph Details

- **Subgraph Name:** `metokens`
- **Version:** `v0.0.1`
- **Deployment ID:** `QmVaWYhk4HKhk9rNQi11RKujTVS4KHF1uHGNVUF4f7xJ53`
- **Project ID:** `project_cmh0iv6s500dbw2p22vsxcfo6`
- **Public Endpoint:** `https://api.goldsky.com/api/public/project_cmh0iv6s500dbw2p22vsxcfo6/subgraphs/metokens/v0.0.1/gn`
- **Network:** Base (Base Mainnet)

## Current Status

- The subgraph endpoint is accessible and can return data when queried directly
- However, the dashboard shows "Failed to transact block operations" error
- The subgraph appears to have stopped indexing new blocks

## What I've Tried

1. Verified the subgraph endpoint is accessible via GraphQL queries
2. Checked that entity names in pipeline configurations match the subgraph schema
3. Reviewed the subgraph logs in the dashboard (though detailed error messages are limited)

## Request

Could you please:
1. Investigate why the subgraph is failing to transact block operations
2. Check if there are any underlying issues with the subgraph deployment
3. Advise on whether a reset/redeploy is needed, or if there's a different solution
4. Provide any recommendations for preventing this issue in the future

## Additional Context

I'm planning to deploy pipelines that depend on this subgraph, so getting it back to a healthy state is important for my project.

Thank you for your time and assistance. Please let me know if you need any additional information.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
