Audius API
The Audius REST API provides programmatic access to one of the largest open music catalogs on the internet. Query, stream, and search for tracks, users, and playlists across the Open Audio Protocol using the Audius API.

API Endpoints
We provide two API versions:

Basic API
The Basic API (https://api.audius.co/v1) provides all essential endpoints for querying tracks, users, playlists, and more. This is the recommended starting point for most integrations.

Full API
The Full API (https://api.audius.co/v1/full) includes additional data for advanced use cases. Every basic API endpoint also has a full version available. Fields in the full API may change over time and are not guaranteed to be backwards compatible.

tip
If you're developing with AI, upload the swagger.yaml file to your development environment.

Usage
1. Include App Name
Always include the app_name parameter in your requests to identify your application:

curl "https://api.audius.co/v1/tracks/trending?app_name=MyAwesomeApp"

You may also create a developer app on audius.co/settings and provide that instead of your app name

curl "https://api.audius.co/v1/tracks/trending?api_key=8acf5eb7436ea403ee536a7334faa5e9ada4b50f"

2. Rate Limits
The Audius API is free to use with zero rate limits. We ask that you respect artist rights and proper attribution.

3. Authentication
Most endpoints are public and don't require authentication. For operations that require authentication (like uploading content or managing your profile), refer to the SDK Docs.
