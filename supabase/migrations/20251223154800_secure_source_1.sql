-- This is required for the SELECT policy to function
GRANT SELECT ON public.source_1 TO anon, authenticated;

-- Revoke modification permissions from public roles to ensure they can't write
-- (Even without this, RLS would block them if no INSERT/UPDATE policies exist, 
-- but this provides an extra layer of security at the table privilege level)
REVOKE INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, TRUNCATE ON public.source_1 FROM anon, authenticated, public;

-- Create Policy 1: Allow public read access
-- "true" means any row is visible to anyone with SELECT permissions
CREATE POLICY "Enable read access for all users" ON public.source_1

-- No policies are created for INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE.
-- This intentionally adheres to the "Service Write Only" model.
-- The Supabase 'service_role' key bypasses RLS and can still write.
