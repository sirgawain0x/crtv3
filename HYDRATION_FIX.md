# Hydration Mismatch Fix

## Problem
The application was experiencing hydration mismatches with Radix UI components, specifically dropdown menus in the `AccountDropdown` component. The error occurred because Radix UI generates random IDs for accessibility purposes, and these IDs differ between server-side rendering and client-side hydration.

## Error Details
```
A tree hydrated but some attributes of the server rendered HTML didn't match the client properties.
The button IDs were different:
- Server: `id="radix-_R_cqmelb_"`
- Client: `id="radix-_R_1jaqlb_"`
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. HydrationSafe Component
Created `/components/ui/hydration-safe.tsx` that prevents hydration mismatches by:
- Only rendering children after the component has mounted on the client
- Providing fallback UI during server-side rendering
- Ensuring consistent rendering between server and client

### 2. RadixProvider Component
Created `/components/ui/radix-provider.tsx` that:
- Wraps all Radix UI components at the application level
- Prevents rendering of Radix components until after client mount
- Uses `visibility: hidden` as a fallback to maintain layout

### 3. Updated AccountDropdown
Modified `/components/account-dropdown/AccountDropdown.tsx` to:
- Wrap dropdown menus with `HydrationSafe` components
- Provide fallback buttons that match the expected UI during SSR
- Maintain the same visual appearance and functionality

### 4. Updated Providers
Modified `/app/providers.tsx` to:
- Include the `RadixProvider` at the application level
- Ensure all Radix UI components are wrapped consistently

## Files Modified
- `/components/ui/hydration-safe.tsx` (new)
- `/components/ui/radix-provider.tsx` (new)
- `/components/account-dropdown/AccountDropdown.tsx`
- `/app/providers.tsx`
- `/app/layout.tsx` (already had `suppressHydrationWarning`)

## Benefits
1. **Eliminates hydration mismatches** - No more console errors
2. **Maintains functionality** - All dropdown interactions work as expected
3. **Preserves performance** - Minimal impact on rendering performance
4. **Consistent UI** - Fallback components match the final rendered state
5. **Future-proof** - Solution works for all Radix UI components

## Usage
The fix is automatically applied to all Radix UI components through the provider structure. For new components using Radix UI, wrap them with `HydrationSafe` if needed:

```tsx
<HydrationSafe fallback={<FallbackComponent />}>
  <RadixComponent />
</HydrationSafe>
```

## Testing
To verify the fix:
1. Start the development server: `yarn dev`
2. Open browser console
3. Navigate to pages with dropdown menus
4. Confirm no hydration mismatch errors appear
5. Test dropdown functionality works correctly
