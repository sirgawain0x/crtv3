# Production Readiness Assessment

**Date**: January 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **IMPROVED** - Rate limiting, console→logger migration, NFT config handling, and MeToken caching are complete. Remaining items are optional hardening.

## Executive Summary

The application has a solid foundation. Recent fixes have addressed:

1. **Rate limiting** – Applied to ~20 mutating/sensitive API routes (strict/standard/generous tiers).
2. **Console → logger migration** – `console.*` replaced with `logger` / `serverLogger` across lib, components, app, context (excluding scripts, examples, services, supabase/functions).
3. **NFT minting config** – `isNftMintingConfigured` via `/api/story/mint-configured`; upload flow hides NFT step or shows "NFT minting unavailable" when `STORY_PROTOCOL_PRIVATE_KEY` is not set.
4. **MeToken holdings** – Client-side cache (45s TTL) added to reduce redundant RPC calls.

Remaining considerations: optional error monitoring (Sentry), subgraph optimization for MeToken scalability, and smart-wallet mapping for other users (documented limitation).

## ✅ What's Ready

### Infrastructure & Configuration
- ✅ **Next.js 16** with Turbopack configured
- ✅ **Environment variable validation** with Zod schema
- ✅ **Error boundaries** implemented
- ✅ **Logger utility** created (production-safe logging)
- ✅ **PWA support** configured
- ✅ **Security headers** (CSP, COOP, COEP) configured
- ✅ **Image optimization** with multiple IPFS gateways
- ✅ **TypeScript** throughout the codebase
- ✅ **No linter errors**

### Core Features
- ✅ **Smart Account integration** (Account Kit)
- ✅ **Video streaming** (Livepeer)
- ✅ **Database** (Supabase with RLS)
- ✅ **IPFS storage** (Lighthouse + Storacha hybrid)
- ✅ **MeToken system** (Alchemy integration)
- ✅ **Story Protocol** integration
- ✅ **Turbo pipelines** configured

### Testing
- ✅ **Solidity tests** (Foundry)
- ✅ **TypeScript tests** (Vitest)
- ✅ **Integration test scripts** available

---

## ✅ Completed Fixes (January 2025)

### 1. Rate Limiting
- **Strict (5/min)**: `swap/execute`, `story/prepare-mint`, `story/mint-derivative`, `story/factory/deploy-collection` (`story/mint` and `story/transfer` are disabled stubs but may still be rate-limited if re-enabled)
- **Standard (10/min)**: AI, IPFS, creator-profiles, POAP, membership, unlock, metokens, video-assets sync-views, livepeer
- **Generous (20/min)**: `poap-proxy` POST, `reality-eth-subgraph`, `metokens-subgraph`
- **Token-gate**: Skipped (Livepeer webhook); relies on `accessKey` + timestamp validation

### 2. Console → Logger Migration
- `console.*` replaced with `logger` / `serverLogger` across lib, components, app, context
- Excluded: `logger.ts`, scripts, examples, services, supabase/functions, `*.md`, webpack

### 3. NFT Minting Config
- `GET /api/story/mint-configured` returns `{ configured }` based on `STORY_PROTOCOL_PRIVATE_KEY`
- Upload flow uses `useNftMintingConfigured`; shows "NFT minting unavailable" or skeleton when not configured
- `ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md` documents NFT minting env vars

### 4. MeToken Holdings Cache
- Client-side cache (45s TTL) keyed by address in `useMeTokenHoldings`
- Reduces redundant subgraph + RPC calls on re-render or revisit

### 5. Smart Wallet Mapping
- **Known limitation** documented: EOA → smart wallet only for current user; other users return null until DB/Delegate.cash/registry support

---

## ⚠️ Optional / Follow-up

### Subgraph Optimization (MeToken Holdings)
- O(N) loop remains; cache reduces repeat work. Long-term: index ERC20 `Transfer` events, query `meTokenBalances` by user.

### Error Monitoring
- Integrate Sentry or similar for production error tracking (logger TODOs reference this).

---

### Environment Variables

**Required** (from `config/index.ts`): `NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_API_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `LIVEPEER_API_KEY`.

**Optional**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_PAYMASTER_POLICY_ID`, `LIVEPEER_WEBHOOK_ID`, Coinbase CDP, Lighthouse, Storacha, `STORY_PROTOCOL_PRIVATE_KEY` (for NFT minting). See `ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md`.

**Action**: Verify required variables in production.

---

## ⚠️ Optional Follow-up

### Error Handling
- Most API routes have error handling; some paths could be strengthened.
- Review `app/api/**`, `lib/hooks/**`, `components/**` as needed.

### Performance
- MeToken holdings: O(N) loop remains; 45s client cache reduces repeat work. Long-term: subgraph `meTokenBalances` indexing.
- Consider profiling, React.memo, and caching where appropriate.

### Security
- ✅ Security headers, RLS, env validation, rate limiting, logger migration (no raw console).
- Optional: Sentry, API auth review, XSS audit.

## 📋 Pre-Production Checklist

### Code Quality
- [x] Replace console statements with logger utility (lib, components, app, context)
- [x] Add rate limiting to sensitive API routes
- [x] NFT minting config check; hide step when unconfigured
- [ ] Fix remaining TODO/placeholder implementations (optional)
- [ ] Verify error handling in all critical paths
- [ ] Run full test suite and ensure 100% pass rate
- [ ] Code review for security vulnerabilities

### Configuration
- [ ] Set all required environment variables in production
- [ ] Verify environment variable validation works
- [ ] Configure production API keys (separate from dev)
- [ ] Set up monitoring/alerting (Sentry, LogRocket, etc.)
- [ ] Configure error tracking

### Testing
- [ ] Run all unit tests
- [ ] Run all integration tests
- [ ] Run all Solidity tests
- [ ] Manual testing of critical user flows
- [ ] Load testing (if applicable)
- [ ] Security audit (recommended)

### Infrastructure
- [ ] Verify database migrations are applied
- [ ] Verify Turbo pipelines are deployed
- [ ] Verify subgraphs are synced
- [ ] Set up backup/recovery procedures
- [ ] Configure CDN (if applicable)
- [ ] Set up SSL certificates

### Documentation
- [ ] Update README with production setup instructions
- [ ] Document all environment variables
- [ ] Document deployment process
- [ ] Create runbook for common issues

## ✅ Conclusion

**Current Status**: ✅ **READY FOR PRODUCTION** (with env and ops checks)

Rate limiting, logger migration, NFT config handling, and MeToken caching are complete. Swap execution, X402 balance checks, and the main NFT minting flow are implemented. Ensure required env vars are set, run the test suite, and deploy to staging before production.

**Recommendation**: Set production env vars, run tests, then deploy. Optionally add Sentry and subgraph optimization later.

## 📝 Notes

- The codebase is well-structured and follows good practices
- Infrastructure is solid and production-ready
- Rate limiting, logging, and NFT config are addressed
- Smart-wallet mapping for other users is a known limitation (documented)
