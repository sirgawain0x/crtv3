# Error Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

This document outlines the three console errors that were identified and fixed in the codebase.

---

## 1. MeTokens Subgraph 500 Error

### Error
```
GraphQL Error (Code: 500): Subgraph request failed
Failed to fetch MeTokens from subgraph
```

### Root Cause
The subgraph API proxy was returning a 500 error when trying to query the MeTokens subgraph. This was likely due to:
- Missing or invalid `SUBGRAPH_QUERY_KEY` environment variable
- Network issues with the Satsuma subgraph endpoint
- Subgraph indexing issues

### Fixes Applied

#### 1. Enhanced Error Handling in API Route (`app/api/metokens-subgraph/route.ts`)
- Added comprehensive logging with emojis for better visibility
- Added specific error messages for different failure scenarios (401, 404, 500)
- Added helpful hints for debugging configuration issues
- Better environment variable validation with actionable error messages

#### 2. Graceful Degradation in Hook (`lib/hooks/metokens/useMeTokenHoldings.ts`)
- Wrapped subgraph query in try-catch to handle failures gracefully
- Changed error behavior: now returns empty holdings instead of crashing
- Added warning log instead of throwing error
- App continues to function even if subgraph is unavailable

#### 3. Better Error Messages in Subgraph Client (`lib/sdk/metokens/subgraph.ts`)
- Added detailed logging for debugging
- Enhanced error messages with context-specific hints
- Added GraphQL error detection
- Better distinction between different types of failures

### Configuration Required

To fully resolve this issue, you need to:

1. **Get a Subgraph Query Key**:
   - Visit https://app.satsuma.xyz/
   - Sign up or log in
   - Get your API query key for the MeTokens subgraph

2. **Set Environment Variable**:
   Add to your `.env.local` file:
   ```env
   SUBGRAPH_QUERY_KEY=your_satsuma_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Restart Development Server**:
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

### Testing
After setting the environment variable, the console should show:
```
‚úÖ Query key available
üîó Forwarding to subgraph endpoint: https://subgraph.satsuma-prod.com/***/...
‚úÖ Subgraph query successful
```

## 2. CreateThumbnail: No Asset ID Error

### Error
```
CreateThumbnail: No asset ID provided!
```

### Root Cause
The `CreateThumbnail` component was rendering before the `livepeerAsset` state was properly set in the parent component, resulting in an undefined `livePeerAssetId` prop.

### Fixes Applied

#### 1. Better State Management (`components/Videos/Upload/index.tsx`)
- Added validation before calling `onPressNext`
- Added comprehensive logging to track asset flow
- Set `livepeerAsset` state immediately when received
- Added error handling for database operations
- Added user-friendly error toasts

#### 2. Enhanced UI Feedback (`components/Videos/Upload/Create-thumbnail.tsx`)
- Added conditional rendering based on asset ID presence
- Display helpful error message when asset ID is missing
- Provide "Go Back" button to retry upload
- Better logging to diagnose issues
- Removed redundant error toast (only show in UI now)

#### 3. Improved Error Detection
- Enhanced logging with more context
- Better error messages for debugging
- Clearer indication of what went wrong

### User Experience Improvements
- Users now see a clear error state instead of silent failure
- "Go Back" button allows easy recovery
- Better feedback during the upload process
- Console logs help developers diagnose issues

---

## 3. Error Handling Best Practices Applied

### General Improvements Across All Fixes

1. **Graceful Degradation**
   - App continues to work even when optional features fail
   - MeToken holdings is non-critical, so failures don't break the app

2. **Better Logging**
   - Added emoji prefixes for easy scanning (üîç ‚úÖ ‚ùå ‚ö†Ô∏è üí°)
   - More context in log messages
   - Structured logging with objects

3. **User-Friendly Error Messages**
   - Clear explanation of what went wrong
   - Actionable hints on how to fix issues
   - Recovery options provided in UI

4. **Developer Experience**
   - Better debugging information
   - Clear separation of error types
   - Helpful hints in console and API responses

## Testing Checklist

### MeTokens Subgraph
- [ ] Set `SUBGRAPH_QUERY_KEY` environment variable
- [ ] Restart development server
- [ ] Check console for successful subgraph queries
- [ ] Verify portfolio page loads MeToken holdings
- [ ] Test with invalid key to verify error handling

### Video Upload Flow
- [ ] Upload a video file
- [ ] Verify asset ID is passed to CreateThumbnail
- [ ] Check console logs for asset flow
- [ ] Test thumbnail generation
- [ ] Verify publish button works correctly

### Error Recovery
- [ ] Test upload without valid asset (should show error UI)
- [ ] Verify "Go Back" button works
- [ ] Test with subgraph unavailable (should gracefully degrade)
- [ ] Check that app doesn't crash on errors

## Files Modified

1. `app/api/metokens-subgraph/route.ts` - Enhanced error handling and logging
2. `lib/sdk/metokens/subgraph.ts` - Better error messages and detection
3. `lib/hooks/metokens/useMeTokenHoldings.ts` - Graceful degradation
4. `components/Videos/Upload/index.tsx` - Better state management and validation
5. `components/Videos/Upload/Create-thumbnail.tsx` - Enhanced UI error handling

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Configure Subgraph Access**:
   - Get API key from Satsuma
   - Add to environment variables
   - Test MeToken features

### Recommended Improvements
1. **Add Health Check Endpoint**:
   - Create `/api/health` to check subgraph connectivity
   - Display status in admin panel

2. **Add Retry Logic**:
   - Implement exponential backoff for subgraph queries
   - Auto-retry failed requests

3. **Add Telemetry**:
   - Track subgraph query success rates
   - Monitor video upload success rates
   - Alert on high error rates

4. **Improve Upload Flow**:
   - Add progress indicators at each step
   - Save partial progress in localStorage
   - Allow resume from failed uploads

## Support

If you continue to experience issues:

1. **Check Console Logs**: Look for emoji-prefixed messages
2. **Verify Environment Variables**: Ensure all required variables are set
3. **Check Network Tab**: Look for failed API requests
4. **Review Server Logs**: Check Next.js terminal output

For subgraph-specific issues:
- Visit https://app.satsuma.xyz/
- Check subgraph indexing status
- Verify API key permissions
- Review subgraph documentation

---

## Summary

All three errors have been addressed with:
- ‚úÖ Better error handling and graceful degradation
- ‚úÖ Enhanced logging and debugging information
- ‚úÖ Improved user experience with clear error states
- ‚úÖ Actionable error messages with hints

The app will now continue to function even when optional features (like MeTokens) fail, and users will receive clear feedback when something goes wrong.
